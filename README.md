# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Analyze client churn in the banking sector

Customer churn in banking applies to the occurrence in which a bank has lost customers for a
variety of reasons. This can occur for a variety of causes, including unhappiness with the bank's
services, better offers or services from rivals, changes in client requirements or financial
conditions, or a general degradation in the bank's brand impression. Because recruiting new
clients is often more expensive than maintaining current ones, churn may have a major impact
on a bank's income and market share. Furthermore, high turnover rates can have a negative
influence on a bank's reputation and client loyalty, making it critical for banks to recognize and
address the root causes of churn in order to retain a stable and pleased customer base.
